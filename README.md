magnum.fd
===========

magnum.fd is a finite-difference/FFT package for the solution of dynamical micromagnetic problems. It is written in Python, C++ and Cuda C and runs on CPU as well as GPU.

Original Project MicroMagnum
----------------------------
magnum.fd is forked from MicroMagnum (https://github.com/MicroMagnum/MicroMagnum) that was developed by the MicroMagnum Team:

* Andre Drews (Head of Team)
* Gunnar Selke (Lead Developer)
* Benjamin Krueger   
  - Accurate (and fast!) calculation of the demagnetization tensor, with support for periodic boundary conditions.
  - Oersted field module (in development)
* Claas Abert        
  - Calculation of the demagnetization field from its scalar potential.
* Theo Gerhardt      
  - Geometrical shapes for the simulation description.
